# Homework 4

[1] I'd transform `degree` to create our treatment variable *d*. What would you do and why?

[2] Build a model to predict *d* from **x**, our controls. Comment on how tight the fit is, and what that implies for estimation of a treatment effect.

[3] Use predictions from [2] in an estimator for effect of *d* on `loan`.

[4] Compare the results from [3] to those from a straight (naive) lasso for `loan` on *d* and **x**. Explain why they are similar or different.

[5] Bootstrap your estimator from [3] and describe the uncertainty.

[+] Can you think of how you'd design an experiment to estimate the treatment effect of network degree?
